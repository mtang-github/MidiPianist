# MidiPianist
A Piano GUI for visualizing MIDI files

The program must be provided with a command line argument for the synthesizer to connect to.
Otherwise, the program will default to the Microsoft MIDI Mapper, which will not work on non-microsoft operating systems.

To play a MIDI file, the user must drag and drop a file ending in .mid over the GUI. Playback will begin immediately.
